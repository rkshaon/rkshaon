I' building high-performance ERP application's APIs with Python, Django, PostgreSQL.

As an enginner I try to write readable, comparatively correct, reliable, reusable, extensible, flexible, efficient code.

I am good at analysing requirements, design ininteractive application.


My goal is to make the Python ecosystem more productive by building faster developer tools.

I was most recently a staff software engineer at Spring Discovery. Before that, I was a senior software engineer at Khan Academy.
