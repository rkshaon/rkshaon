                    Hello! I'm <strong>Rezaul Karim Shaon</strong>, a passionate <strong>Software Engineer</strong>
                    currently serving as the <strong>Backend Team Lead</strong> at <strong>Pflegetech GmbH</strong>.
                    With over three years of experience in the software industry, I've honed my skills in designing
                    and developing robust backend systems, ensuring that the core of any application I work on is both
                    scalable and efficient.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    My journey in tech began as an apprentice, and from the very start, I've been driven by a deep
                    curiosity and a desire to become a software architect or system designer. I thrive on challenges and
                    constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow. My expertise includes a wide array of technologies
                    such as <strong>Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, JavaScript, Vue3, PostgreSQL, pl/pgSQL,
                        WebSocket,
                    </strong> and <strong>Django Channels</strong>. These tools and frameworks have empowered me to
                    build
                    everything from personal accounting software (a project still under wraps) to comprehensive systems
                    like an online bus ticket
                    booking platform.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    In my current role, I'm focused on advancing my knowledge and skills to eventually achieve my goal
                    of becoming a software architect or system designer. I believe that continuous learning is key to
                    growth, and I strive to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Outside of work, I value maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Whether it's hanging out with friends or
                    simply relaxing, I understand the importance of recharging to stay productive and creative.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    When it comes to problem-solving, my philosophy is straightforward yet effective: <strong>listen
                    carefully, break down the problem into smaller parts, and tackle each one methodically.</strong>
                    I believe that by understanding each component of a problem, the solution becomes much clearer and more manageable.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and take on new challenges. If you're
                    looking for someone who combines technical expertise with a thoughtful approach to problem-solving,
                    let's connect!
